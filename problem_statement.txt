Problem Statement

--> Design a computer vision–based system that estimates calories and macronutrients        (carbohydrates, protein, fat) of Indian dishes from a single food image, using deep learning for dish recognition and heuristic portion estimation combined with recipe-based nutritional priors.

Why this matters:

--> Indian food is visually complex, highly mixed, and varies by cooking style, making calorie estimation difficult using existing food recognition systems.
